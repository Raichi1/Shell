## Description
A shell is a command-line interface that serves as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, allowing users to interact with the system by executing commands. It provides a way to launch programs, manage files, and perform various tasks by interpreting user input. Shells can offer scripting capabilities, customization through configuration files, and access to a wide range of system utilities, making them a fundamental component of operating systems for both novice and advanced users.
